-   Our objective is to discover which health or economic factors of a nation impacts the country's average life expectancy the most

-   We aim to craft a model that has high predictive power on life expectancy, but also allows for inferable results that could be interpreted by professionals in the field of global health

-   Government officials can use these findings to make data-driven decisions about the health of their people

## Data Description

-   Data from the Global Healthy Observatory's (GHO) data repository, made public for global health data analysis
-   Health factors collected from GHO repository, economic data collected from United Nations' website
-   Each observation represents nation in a given year and includes health and economic data, as well as each nation's life expectancy for that year
-   22 variables:
    -   20 predictors (see next slides)
    -   1 response: life expectancy, in years

## Data Dictionary

-   `Year`: Year country's GHO data
-   `Status`: Developmental status of country (Developed or Developing)
-   `life_exp`: Average expectancy in country (years)
-   `adult_mortality`: Number of deaths of people aged 15-60 per 1000 people
-   `infant_mortality`: Number of infants deaths per 1000 infants

## Data Dictionary

-   `Alcohol`: Alcohol consumption per capita (liters of pure alcohol)
-   `pct_expend`: Expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP per capita
-   `hep_b`: Hepatitis B immunization rate among 1-year-olds (%)
-   `Measles`: Number of Measles cases reported per 1000 people
-   `BMI`: Average BMI (Body Mass Index) of entire country's population

## Data Dictionary

-   `under_five_deaths`: Number of deaths of 5-year-olds or younger per 1000 people
-   `Polio`: Polio immunization rate among 1-year-olds (%)
-   `tot_expend`: Government expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of total government expenditure
-   `Diphtheria`: Diphtheria tetnus toxoid and pertussis immunization rate among 1-year-olds (%)
-   `hiv_aids`: Number of deaths of 0-4 year-olds from HIV/AIDS per 1000 live births

## Data Dictionary

-   `GDP`: GDP per capita
-   `Population`: Total population of country
-   `thinnes_adole`: Prevalence of "thinness" among adolescents aged 10-19 (%)
-   `thinness_infant`: Prevalence of "thinness" among infants aged 5-9 (%)
-   `income_comp`: Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (0 to 1)
-   `Schooling`: Average number of years of schooling

## Inference and Prediction Goals

-   There are some important research questions that the dataset can help us answer. For instance:

    -   What impacts `Life Expectancy` the most?

    -   What is the relationship between `Life Expectancy` and the other predictors?

    -   Can we predict an increase or decrease in `Life Expectancy` in the future? i.e. Time Series Analysis?

    -   How well can we predict `Life Expectancy` given the data we have?

## Possible Modeling Strategies

1.  Lasso Regression:
    -   This model has many predictors. Can we select the most important ones using Lasso?
2.  Linear and Nonlinear Regression
3.  Boosting, Bagging, and general Trees:
    1.  Given that the relationship between Linear and Nonlinear Regression is not linear, can we use `Tree-based models` to predict?

## How Will we Select the Best Model?

-   We aim to select a model with good performance without sacrificing much inference
-   Our primary goals are to find what health or economic factors of a country impact their average life expectancy and allow for interpretable results that can be helpful to the field of global health
-   We will choose a model with relatively small test error and one whose results/predictions are interpretable
-   Thus, we will not necessarily choose the model with the lowest test MSE
