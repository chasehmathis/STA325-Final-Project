## Introduction

-   We aim to investigate the relationship between controllable macro-factors and life expectancy for developing nations and those who already have high life expectancy.
-   Our audience are global health experts as well as government officials and policymakers and aim to give them suggestions based on our finds on what should be prioritized in keeping their citizens healthy and increasing life expectancy

## Relevance

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Public Policy and Health Policy have almost intertwined in the past few years with the pandemic
-   Data-driven approaches are not only useful, but necessary
-   Life expectancy has decreased in recent years
-   Help health experts understand factors that affect life expectancy

## Research Questions

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}

![](images/questionmark.png){width="750"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   The research is guided by two research questions:

    -   \(1\) *Given a country is developing, what can they do to increase their Life Expectancy?*
    -   \(2\) *For countries that already have a high life expectancy, is it economically beneficial to attempt to marginally increase life expectancy?*

## Data

```{r}
#| label: na-values-table
na_table <- life |>  
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) |> 
  pivot_longer(everything()) |> 
  arrange(desc(value)) |> 
  mutate(percent_missing =  (100*value/nrow(life))) |> 
  slice(1:5) |> 
  dplyr::select(-value) |> 
  kable(col.names = c("Term", "Percent Missing"), caption = c("Variables with Missing Values"), digits = 2)
```

```{r}
percent_na <- 1-(nrow(na.omit(life))/nrow(life))
life <- life |> 
  group_by(Country) |> 
  mutate(Alcohol = replace_na(Alcohol, mean(Alcohol, na.rm = TRUE)),
         Population = replace_na(Population, mean(Population, na.rm = TRUE)),
         hep_b = replace_na(hep_b, mean(hep_b, na.rm = TRUE)),
         GDP = replace_na(GDP, mean(GDP, na.rm = TRUE)),
        tot_expend = replace_na(tot_expend, mean(tot_expend, na.rm = TRUE)),
        income_comp = replace_na(income_comp, mean(income_comp, na.rm = TRUE)),
        Schooling = replace_na(Schooling, mean(Schooling, na.rm = TRUE))) |> 
  ungroup()

percent_na_after <- 1-(nrow(na.omit(life))/nrow(life))
```

## Limitations of Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The data has null values which throw errors when we fit models

-   We attempt to decrease the proportion of null values by taking the mean

-   In the end, we decrease the proportion from `r round(percent_na,3)` to `r round(percent_na_after,3)`
