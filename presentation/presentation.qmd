## Introduction

-   We aim to investigate the relationship between controllable macro-factors and life expectancy for developing nations and those who already have high life expectancy.
-   Our audience are global health experts as well as government officials and policymakers and aim to give them suggestions based on our finds on what should be prioritized in keeping their citizens healthy and increasing life expectancy

## Relevance

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Public Policy and Health Policy have almost intertwined in the past few years with the pandemic
-   Data-driven approaches are not only useful, but necessary
-   Life expectancy has decreased in recent years
-   Help health experts understand factors that affect life expectancy

## Research Questions

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/questionmark.png){width="750"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   The research is guided by two research questions:

    -   \(1\) *Given a country is developing, what can they do to increase their Life Expectancy?*
    -   \(2\) *For countries that already have a high life expectancy, is it economically beneficial to attempt to marginally increase life expectancy?*

## Data

```{r}
#| label: na-values-table
na_table <- life |>  
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) |> 
  pivot_longer(everything()) |> 
  arrange(desc(value)) |> 
  mutate(percent_missing =  (100*value/nrow(life))) |> 
  slice(1:5) |> 
  dplyr::select(-value) |> 
  kable(col.names = c("Term", "Percent Missing"), caption = c("Variables with Missing Values"), digits = 2)
```

```{r}
percent_na <- 1-(nrow(na.omit(life))/nrow(life))
life <- life |> 
  group_by(Country) |> 
  mutate(Alcohol = replace_na(Alcohol, mean(Alcohol, na.rm = TRUE)),
         Population = replace_na(Population, mean(Population, na.rm = TRUE)),
         hep_b = replace_na(hep_b, mean(hep_b, na.rm = TRUE)),
         GDP = replace_na(GDP, mean(GDP, na.rm = TRUE)),
        tot_expend = replace_na(tot_expend, mean(tot_expend, na.rm = TRUE)),
        income_comp = replace_na(income_comp, mean(income_comp, na.rm = TRUE)),
        Schooling = replace_na(Schooling, mean(Schooling, na.rm = TRUE))) |> 
  ungroup()
percent_na_after <- 1-(nrow(na.omit(life))/nrow(life))
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Data collected from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) under World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations website via Kaggle
-   22 variables:
-   Response: `life_exp`
-   Controllable features: `Alcohol`, `pct_expend`, `hep_b`, `Polio`, `tot_expend`, `Diphtheria`, `Schooling`

## Limitations of Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The data has null values which throw errors when we fit models

-   We attempt to decrease the proportion of null values by taking the mean

-   In the end, we decrease the proportion from `r round(percent_na,3)` to `r round(percent_na_after,3)`

## Methodology

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   We will use only interpretable statistical models such as:

    -   GAMS, Trees, Linear Regression

-   Show the results of the models and the limitations of them

-   Make conclusions on interaction and individual effects of each variable on life expectancy

## Life Expectancy in Developing Nations

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Health officials in developing countries are tasked with difficult jobs

-   A healthy population is vital for developing countries

-   Can we advise health officials to pinpoint important policies that make the biggest difference?

-   To do this, we fit a model using only developing countries' data

## Results: Schooling is the [Most]{.underline} Important

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Schooling, which is relatively cheap was found to be the most important predictor in increasing a developing nations life expectancy

-   On average an increase of one year of schooling is related to an increase in over two years in life expectancy given the country is developing

## Conclusion

::: columns

![](images/alcohol.jpeg) ![](images/schooling2.jpeg)
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   We propose that for developing countries, schooling is a low-cost effective method to increase the life expectancy of a nation

-   For countries with high life expectancy, alcohol is the largest contributor to a lower life expectancy. Look to invest in social programs
